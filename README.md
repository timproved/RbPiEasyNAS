# RbPiEasyNAS

This Project is intended for the non technical User, that wants a nice GUI to access External Drives, connected to 
a Raspberry Pi in a NAS like fashion.

The idea is that the user can connect to their Raspberry Pi, see the accessible drives and be able to manipulate them.
Thus having a fully featured, budget friendly NAS at one's hands with just a Raspberry Pi and an external drive

-- Still Work in Progess --
